Kermit the Frog: Kidnapping Jack Black, Fozzie!
Kermit the Frog: Anyway, listen everybody, we've got nothing to be ashamed of. And you know why?

And I don't care what anybody says, I don't care if no one believes in us because ... I believe. I believe in you.
And you. And you. You know what's important isn't this building or name, it's each other.
So I say fine, let's just start from the bottom and work our way back up to the top.
Let's all walk out through these doors with our heads held up high, as a family because that's what we are.
