I don't <FEELING> anything here at all. said Frodo, step or <NOUN>, breath or bone.
<NOUN>, air and water all seem <FEELING>. But so our path is laid.
Yes, that's so, said Sam, And we shouldn't <VERB> here at all, if we'd known more about it before we started.
But I suppose it's often that way.
The <ADJECTIVE> things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo, adventures, as I used to call them.
I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and <VERB> for, because
they wanted them, because they were <FEELING> and life was a bit dull, a kind of a <NOUN>, as you might say.
But that's not the way of it with the tales that really <FEELING>, or the ones that stay in the mind. 
Folk seem to have been just <VERB> in them, usually their paths were laid that way, as <PRONOUN> put it.
But <PRONOUN> expect they had lots of chances, like us, of <VERB> back, only they didn't.
And if <PRONOUN> had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been <VERB>.
We hear about those as just went on, and not all to a good <NOUN>, mind you; at least not to what folk inside
a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right,
though not quite the same; like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the <ADJECTIVE> tales to hear, though they
may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into?
I <VERB>, said Frodo, But I don't know. And that's the way of a <ADJECTIVE> tale.
Take any one that you're <FEELING> of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or
<FEELING>-ending, but the people in it don't know. And you don't want them to.
THE END.
